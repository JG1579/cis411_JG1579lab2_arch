# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [/ ] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [/ ] I have reviewed the [lecture / discsussion](../assets/04p1_SolutionArchitectures.pdf) on architecture patterns.
- [ /] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Analyze the Proposal
Serve Central is a mobile application that allows users to find events that are looking for volunteer opportunitites. On the app you are able to see what the event is, where the event is located, and what kind of volunteers are needed.

## Step 2.1 Representative Use Cases  


| Use Case #1 |Volunteer|
|---|---|
| Title | Signing up to volunteer |
| Description / Steps |<ol> <li> User will login to their account </li><li> User searches through desired events based on the time, event type, and location </li><li> User selects an event and fills out required information </li><li> User will confirm their registration </li><li> User is given registration confirmation </li><li> User is directed back to original search page  |
| Primary Actor |Volunteer |
| Preconditions |<ol> <li> User has created an account </li><li> Serve Central is running and available to use |
| Postconditions |<ol> <li> User is notified of completed signup </li><li> User is notified with instructions about the event and any changes that may occur  |

| Use Case #2 | |
|---|---|
| Title |Creating Volunteering Event |
| Description / Steps |<ol> <li> Orgainization will login to their account </li><li> Organization selects new event registration </li><li> Organization fills out information about event </li><li> Organizations confirms registering their event </li><li> Organization is given confirmation of registered event </li><li> Organization is directed back to original page |
| Primary Actor |Organization |
| Preconditions |<ol> <li> Organization has created an organization account </li><li> Serve Central is running and available to use  |
| Postconditions |<ol> <li> Organization is notified of completed event registration </li><li> Organisation confirms event is real <li>Event is displayed so that volnteers can see it| 

## Step 2.2 Define the MVC Components

| Model | View | Controller |
|---|---|---|
|Service Events  | Available Events  |EventController  |
|User Registration |User Account Registration  |UserRegistrationController  |
|Event Location  |Event Information  |EventLocationController  |
|Event  |Event Registration  |EventRegistrationController  |

# Step 3: Enhancing an Architecture

## Step 3.1 Architecture Change Proposal
If Service Central was to expand they should continue to use the MVC architecture. Change to architecture is something that can be costly and difficult to do. The MVC model already in place can be changed in order to meet their new requirements. A drawback of this could be that it is difficult to support multiple similar views that are on the same model. 


## Step 3.2 Revised Architecture Diagram

# Step 4: Scaling an Architecture
INSERT Architectural change proposal here, and how it meets the four new requirements.  Explain both the benefits and draw backs of your proposal.  If the changes are significant, then you need to explain why the changes are necessary versus a nice-to-have enhancement.
